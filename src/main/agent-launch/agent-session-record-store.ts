// Host-private launch-attribution + resume record store (U5). Holds the fields a
// client record must never carry (ruling D1): the immutable `launchSnapshot`, the
// opaque one-release `legacyLaunchConfig`, and the admission launch token. The
// runtime/mobile/paired session DTO exposes only requested/base identity, provider
// metadata, and notice/failure state; those live in the renderer store, not here.
//
// Two lifecycle stages, per plan §577/§579:
//   1. Registration at spawn time by stable pane + terminal id, BEFORE the PTY can
//      emit output/hooks. The provider session is not known yet, so the record is
//      staged and cannot be resumed. Rolled back on spawn failure.
//   2. Provider-session bind once a hook reports the session id: the staged record
//      is promoted to a durable record keyed by the {worktreeId, baseAgent,
//      providerSessionId} ownership key. A resume/fork request names that key and
//      the host loads the private record here. The record survives pane dispose so
//      a slept session still resumes; it is dropped only when explicitly forgotten.
//
// The store is a pure container: legacy-config validation and Agent Teams env
// stripping live in the ingestion/adapter layer, never here.
