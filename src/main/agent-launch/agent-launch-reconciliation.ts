// Pure tri-state reconciliation for a pending agent launch (U4/U5). The provider
// reports one of three liveness results for a launch token — live, absent, or
// unknown — and this maps them to the four persisted recovery outcomes in the
// plan's table. It NEVER polls or sleeps: provider reconnect / terminal-list
// events rerun it. Absence is authoritative only for providers whose terminals
// die with main (local in-process PTYs); daemon/SSH/WSL-relay/remote-runtime
// terminals may outlive main, so their `absent` must come from a real provider
// listing, and a disconnected provider is `unknown`, never a false `absent` that
// would enable a duplicate retry. Electron-free and injectable.
